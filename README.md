# AOC
This is my code for Advent of Code (all the years I particpate in). No written solutions on a wiki for the time being.

# Other notes
- I may not be able to solve all the problems, and may not be able to finish all the problems. I may not do a problem each day, by the way...

# Running these solutions
- Use the `g++` complier: `g++ solution.cpp -o solution` (for UNIX systems, e.g.: Linux, MacOS, OpenBSD) or `g++ solution.cpp -o solution.exe` (for Windows, install mingw)
- Replace `solution.cpp` with `day#.cpp` (e.g.: `day1.cpp`)
- Feel free to replace `solution` or `solution.exe` with your preferred name for the executable.
- Run with `./solution < inputfile.in` or `solution.exe <inputfile.in` (use this with CMD on Windows)
- Replace `inputfile.in` with `day#.in`, like `day1.in`

# Updates
- Completed day 4 (2020) solution! (Quite messy though)
