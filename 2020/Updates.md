# Updates for 2020
- Completed day 4 solution! (Quite messy though)
- Rewriting solutions without `#include <bits/stdc++.h>`
- Removing binary files (you can always make them with a complier :)
- Removing input files as they are different from everyone
- Plan to write Day 13 in python (maybe?)
- Problem 9 part 2 uses a brute force solution, which may be slower on older computers... Realized from [here](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/blob/master/2020/README.md#day-9---encoding-error) that a better solution would be to use binary search to find the two places the subarray starts and ends, and then loop through that subarray for the minimum and maximum values
- ~~Problem 15 part 2 does 22 seconds on my machine. Probably an inefficient algorithm.~~
- Problem 15 solution updated! Used mebeim's optimizations [here](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/blob/master/2020/README.md#part-2-14).
- Problem 16 part 2 has a pretty messy solution... Refer to one with roughly the same idea [from mebeim](https://github.com/mebeim/aoc/blob/master/2020/README.md#part-2-15).
